I built a RAG chatbot that can provide accurate information about Deep Learning and corresponding the techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, etc. The chatbot can also provide accurate information about webs security and how to test the security of a website with various security techniques. The chatbot is hosted on a personal server that can be accessed via API calls.
