- Integrated multiple products received from different teams to provide a working simulation to be used by Air Force Pilots in a Linux Desktop Environment.
- Increased the percentage of successful builds deployed for further testing to pilots and other internal teams by 30%.
- Worked with Bitbucket, JIRA, and other Atlassian products for source version control and other DevSecOps related work. Also, I am very comfortable debugging C/C++ code with GDB.
- I am the point of contact for multiple software products. Delegated work regarding the aforementioned software products to a subset of teammates that were assisting with integrating simulation for the F-35 fighter.
- Developed multiple Python Tkinter GUI applications, Linux command line tools, and data analysis application to be used for LLM finetuning.
- Transitioned the previously setup Jenkins pipelines to GitLab as the team was moving to GitLab for a more uniform set of DevSecOps tools.
- Collected and cleaned data that was then sent off to an internal machine learning team. Helped create a train-eval dataset for that team.
